# Car-Rally-Website

This website project is part of an assignment, and my first ever website.

The Car Rally Website is designed to provide information and updates about upcoming hypothetical car rally events. 
It aims to serve as a hub for car enthusiasts, allowing them to stay informed about rally schedules, routes, and other important details.
