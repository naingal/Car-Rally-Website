              This Website is about vintage and classic car rally events and
              about our club's goals and visions. Vintage was found in March of
              1984 by our former president, Mr. Joe Generic.

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              The rally event for the winter of 2022 will start on 3rd of
              November, 2022, in Paris, France.

            How do I become a member of the club?

            <p>
              There's no immediate way to become a permanent member of our club.
              However, in order to become one, you first have to register
              yourself. After the registeration, you could purchase a ticket to
              the rally event and accquaint yourself with the existing club
              members, and should one of them think you have enough passion or
              ability to contribute to the industry as a whole, you'll be
              invited to the club.
