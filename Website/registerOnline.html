                Each rally will be comprised of : <br />
                <br />
                - Special Stage : a section of closed road at a stage rallying
                event used for timed speed tests. And it is coordinated such
                that each competing racer begins after a set interval, to reduce
                the chance of impedance by other competitors.The driver with the
                lowest overall time for all special stages in an event is the
                winner. Each special stage is usually between 10 kilometres (6.2
                mi) and 30 kilometres (19 mi) in length. Some stages may be as
                long as 50 kilometres (31 miles) in length. <br />

                <br />
                - Transport Stage : Unlike all others, they are not driven on
                closed roads or tracks, but instead in normal traffic, where
                drivers have to obey the speed limits and other laws of the
                road. They are not timed and their purpose is basically to take
                cars from the finish of one special stage to the start of
                another. <br />

                <br />
                - Power Stage : special stage that usually runs as the final
                stage of a rally. Unlike normal special stages, which are timed
                to a tenth of a second, the timing of the Power Stage is to a
                thousandth of a second.
